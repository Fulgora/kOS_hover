# kOS_hover

KSP-Mod required (you can also install it via CKAN):
https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS

(written for kOS v 1.0.0)

File location (just the file 'hover', not the .zip version of the repo!):
Kerbal Space Program\Ships\Script

This script will control the throttle to counter any gravity. That way you can easily move your ship on the surface with RCS controls the same way as in orbit! (E.g. for vertical docking on the surface in order to re-fuel rovers etc.)

The script will stop automatically once you are docked with another ship - otherwise it can be shut down with ctrl+c.
